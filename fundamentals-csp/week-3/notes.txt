bash file: test.sh
run sh test.sh
to make executable: chmod +x ./test.sh (should be in the same directory)
then can just do ./test.sh

to run each time you open terminal
open -a TextEdit ~/.zshrc
in the file add: ~/Desktop/test.sh
you made it executable, so we can just add ~/Desktop/test.sh
~ -> the directory Users/madinabolat
